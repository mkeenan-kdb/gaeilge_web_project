I am a **beginner in irish** - corrections welcome

This is my website I've built to help learn irish.

Try it here: https://mkeenan-kdb.github.io/gaeilge_web_project/

My Youtube where I share progress: https://www.youtube.com/@UncleMick

The sentences come from the github: michmech/irish-sentence-bank
which reads;

`This is a collection of approximately 4,500 sentences in Irish, tokenized and lemmatized, with English translations. Most of the sentences have been hand-picked from published language-learning texts and would serve well as example sentences in a dictionary. Many of the sentences do in fact occur as example sentences in the Pota Focal House Glossary, but many others don't. The tokenization and lemmatization has been done by hand and is believed to be to practically 100% correct.`
